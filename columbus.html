			<p> I've been entertaining this future dream of being an art director for movies. Apparently, a lot of architects find work in the movie industry as set designers and such. Approaching the idea of space from an architectural standpoint is different from a cinephile approach, but both professions appreciate the physical and metaphysical embodiment of what space can provide. <i>Columbus</i></b> is a well-executed devotional and takes because it loves architecture and cinema without inhibition. 
				Here's some things that I love about <i>Columbus</i>:</ul>
					<li>Camerawork: One of the most notable things about <i>Columbus</i> is the way that architecture takes center stage in framing. It's like each building is a character in itself, and Kogonada treats it like such. Characters experience emotions within the spaces that Kogonada's lense provides, and affect the story as much as the plot does. Architecture is healing.  </li>
					<li> Location: who would ever want to go to Ohio? After watching this movie, I do. Shout out to John Kogonada for making me interested in a southern state. It speaks to the power of architecture that you can find man-made beauty in the most mundane spaces. </li>
