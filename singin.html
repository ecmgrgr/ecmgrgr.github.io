			<p> The first time I watched Gene Kelly dance across the screen, I largely missed whatever the stars were saying and got caught up in the singing. I was raised solely on silver screen classics; as an only child, Shirley Temple and Fred Astaire were my biggest icons and I considered them with a familiarity that one might regard close friends. This review feels less to me like a review, and more of a recollection of what makes me love movies. Films like Singin' in the Rain speak to the testament of the enduring power of cinema and the way that movies revive nostalgia. </b>
				Here's some things that I love about <i>Singin' in the Rain</i>:</ul>
					<li>Storyline: <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> obviously boasts a fantastic storyline that resonates within every viewer. There is always something to like when you watch <i>Singin'</i>, and the storyline remains one of the biggest elements to enjoy. I like that the boy-meets-girl storyline isn't center stage - it's a movie about movie making, about Hollywood, and about both romantic and platonic relationships. As a modern viewer (or someone who hasn't taken a film history class), it's hard to understand the huge shifts that occurred as film grew into a standard artistic form. <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> covers the transition to talkies, which caused an uproar in Hollywood at the time. Like the elegant but squeaky Lina Lamont, some stars would not survive the shift to talkies. The 1950s themselves saw the dissolution of the previous studio hierarchy, and the unease in which the entertainment industry found itself in is hidden within the film. </li>
					<li>Costumes: how are the pants so well-tailored? The aesthetic and colors of the costume design are phenomenal, complimenting both the choreography and the set design of <i>Singin'</i>. I'm obsessed with the drape of the camp collar under sweater vests, and the way that the forms cater to movement and the actors' statures. Attention to detail is so appreciated! </li>
					<li>Actors: Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly were already fairly established within the star system before taking on this movie, but on the most recent viewing I found myself interested in Donald O'Connor's character. Aside from his phenomenal acrobatic dance numbers, his comic relief was welcome and acted without being overbearing. He's a good lad, kids. </li>
