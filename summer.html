			<p> I have a particular soft spot for romantic comedies. I have an even bigger soft spot for movies told in an unconventional format. How do I tell you unabashedly that this movie haunts my angsty, adolescent subconcsious and probably will until the end of time? Plus, who doesn't love Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel?</ul>
					<li>Storyline: <i>(500) Days of Summer</i> is breathtaking and heartbreaking, all in one. I can't stop thinking of things to gush over. I love how the story is told with title cards that switch from day to day, and I love that this movie is told from only one side of the story but makes you think about the other side.  This is a story about something as mundane as a breakup, but explores the absolute rawness of the breakup experience. </li>
					<li>Soundtrack: <i>(500) Days of Summer</i> is the first non-musical movie soundtrack I really fell in love with. The Smiths are a classic, but Regina Spektor's warbly voice is such a vivid, melancholy soundtrack that encapsulates the energy of the story itself. The opening narration of the movie is just so iconic, too: "This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront: this is not a love story."  </li>
					<li>Camerawork: I'm obviously biased when it comes to buildings and cityscape shots, but I love that <i> (500) Days of Summer</i> acknowledges archicteture as a testament to the main character. There's a reason why this movie is so screencap-able, and most of it has to do with the way that the camera engulfs Tom. There's this one scene that involves an imaginary 'expectations vs. reality' bit, and the way that both scenes are juxtaposed against each other turly embodies that longing for what could have been. </li>
					<li>Actors: I feel like I don't really have to add anything more than just: Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt. G'bless.</li>
